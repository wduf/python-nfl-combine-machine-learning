# nfl-combine-draft-predictor

In a group of 4, we trained multiple machine learning models using several different approaches (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, linear regression, with and without PCA data) to try to predict what round players would be drafted based on their position NFL Combine performance. The dataset we used is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/savvastj/nfl-combine-data).
